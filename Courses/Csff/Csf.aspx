        <br />
        <div class="auto-style1">
            <p class="auto-style1">Cyber forensics is a branch of digital forensic science pertaining to legal evidence found in cyber space and digital storage media. In the digital age, the need for cyber experts has grown exponentially as the country is heading towards an internet explosion mostly fuelled by e-commerce, e-banking, e-governance and the social media.</p>
            <p class="auto-style1">The current budget allocation towards cyber security is Rs 42.2 crore ($7.76 million) for 2012-13, as against Rs 35.45 crore in 2010-11 out of the $30.4 billion value of India's IT domestic spends.</p>
            <p class="auto-style1">India has seen many attacks on its critical installations and the misuse of social media and internet has brought home the threat of cyber-terrorism, which cyber security experts say the country is poorly equipped to handle.</p>
            <p class="auto-style1">With cyber security impacting the country's security, the national security adviser, announced last month that the government is putting in place a national cyber security architecture to prevent sabotage, espionage and other forms of cyber threats.</p>
            <p class="auto-style1">The national cyber security policy proposed in 2011, will seek to defend national assets against cyber-attacks and seek to provide for protection of citizen’s information. It will also strengthen the Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) to periodically audit, defend and spread awareness on cyber security besides encouraging open standards.</p>
            <p class="auto-style1">It is estimated that India will require five lakh cyber security professionals by 2015 to support its fast growing internet economy as per an estimate by the union ministry of information technology. The financial sector alone is expected to hire over 2 lakh people while telcos, utility sectors, power, oil & gas, airlines, government (law & order and e-governance) will hire the rest. The country's information security market is expected to grow by 18% to reach Rs 1,415 crore in 2013. Despite a continuing economic slowdown cyber security would continue on an upward trajectory, reaching $86 billion in 2016, up from $60 billion in 2012.</p>
            <p class="auto-style1">The University Grants Commission directed all university vice chancellors in the country to introduce curriculum around cyber security in their respective colleges to meet this talent demand.</p>
            <p class="auto-style1">NASSCOM along with DSCI currently operates 8 cyber labs in Bangalore, Chennai, Pune, Thane, Mumbai, Gurgaon, Delhi and Hyderabad and India's first Cyber Forensic Laboratory (CFL) of India was established in Tripura on 11 August 2013. All these factors point towards limitless future in the Cyber Forensics field.</p>
