# Online Video Portal for students
An online video sharing and live-streaming website for students and faculties of SoCS, UPES where they can watch lecture videos, capture live-streaming of events in the campus and interact with each other. You can make changes for your college or for your needs accordingly.

Just add the videos you want to display in the 'Videos' folder in the project. Be sure to keep the name of the videos in the 'Videos' folder same as the name of the video in the database.

This is an ASP .NET web project. The live-streaming is done through YouTube Live in an iframe so there will be some advertisements.

You will need the following softwares/tools for running the project:
1. Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition
2. Microsoft SQL Server 2017 Express Edition
3. Microsost SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) 2017
4. IIS Express Edition
5. A web browser ofcourse

If you need any help in running the project, e-mail me at alizaidi0096@gmail.com
